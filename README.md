Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Elyas, a developer from the Netherlands with with Persian roots and living in Spain. Being a person of many interests, I enjoy working within all spheres of activity. Through my skills gained from coding bootcamps such as in Ironhack Lisbon, self-studying and professional experience, I am building a fluent sleight-of-hand in both frontend and backend technologies and languages.
Because bringing ideas to life as efficient and accurate as possible is really the ultimate goal in life. _And what could be more effective in achieving that goal than coding?_ 🤖
